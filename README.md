# Kickstarter Analysis

1. Given the provided data, what are three conclusions we can draw about Kickstarter campaigns?
>There are more campaigns in the Theater category than any other category. This could indicate that there are fewer options outside of Kickstarter to get funding for these types of projects.

>Campaigns in the Music category have the highest percentage of successes. A campaign in the Music category is very likely to be successful with the exception of Jazz and Faith subcategories. This could indicate people are more willing to pay for new music as long as it isnt Jazz or Faith music.

>Campaigns started in the late spring, April-May, tend to have higher success rates. 

2. What are some limitations of this dataset?
>This data is getting close to four years old, the dataset ends in March 2017.

>Some campaigns may be miss-categorized or fall into multiple categories which could skew data.

3. What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
>I would like to see a pivot table and chart that shows the percentage of successes for each category filtered by subcategory and country. 

>I think it would also be intersting to create a pivot table and chart showing the total amount pledged per category.
